                   <p>Hey guys, I'm outcast and welcome to my site. I will be making top 10 lists about everything I can think of. I enjoy all kinds of 
                       movies and tv shows from drama, oldies, cartoons, anime, and everything in between. Also, I enjoy sports such as football, boxing, track, 
                       basketball, and many more. This is a hobby of mine since I've always liked rating things. Feel to disagree and welcome aboard!
                   </p>

                <li>
                    <h4>Princess Bride</h4>
                    <p>The only non-drama on the list. A feel good movie I can watch everyday. The Princess Bride has true love, sword fighting, comedy,
                        battle of wits, and much more. Second to Casablanca in legendary quotes. Here are a few: <blockquote>"This is true love. You think this happens every day?"
                            "Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while" "My name is inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>The Americans</h4>
                    <p>The Americans took me by surprise. This is not a crime show, it's a love story. Stan and Phillips friendship was very touching
                        and the finale was amazing. You get the feeling Paige and Henry will be okay and that Elizabeth and Phillip will go through anything
                        together.<blockquote>"Maybe we would have met, on a bus" - Elizabeth.</blockquote>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Prisoners</h4>
                    <p>The movie with the greatest detective of all time. Better than Cohle from true detective, Sherlock Holmes, and even Batman. Detective Loki
                        has solve every case he has ever been assigned to. The acting by all actors is perfect. The ending is perfect.<blockquote>"Pray for the best, Prepare
                            for the worst." - Keller</blockquote>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Good Will Hunting</h4>
                    <p>This movie is all heart. As I get older, this movie climbs my top 10 list higher and higher. Both the professor and Sean care 
                        about Will but their methods were very different.  Will needed a father figure not a disciplinarian.  Look up Will and Chuckie scene at
                        the construction site to see what real friendship is.<blockquote>"Do you like apples?" - Will</blockquote>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>The Matrix</h4>
                    <p>I don't know how many times I have screamed, "Trinity help!" as I tried to doge bullets like Neo.
                        The Matrix was ahead of its time. As a kid, I enjoyed it for the action; as an adult, it means so much more. The mystery
                        when we meet Trinity and her fear of the agents. The Matrix franchise is still chasing this movie's success.<blockquote>"Throughout
                            human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony." - Morpheus
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Breaking Bad</h4>
                    <p>After watching <em>Better Call Saul</em>, you appreciate Walter White victory over Fring even more. (Even though Fring was distracted
                    by the Mexican cartel for most of their rivalry and without Mike in the end.) Walter Whites' evolution each season is perfect. Breaking
                Bad is as good as <em>The Wire</em> and <em>The Sopranos</em> but the latter two have bigger worlds with more in depth characters. <blockquote>"I 
                    did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really - I was alive." - W.W
                </blockquote></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>The Sopranos</h4>
                    <p>The deepest set of fictional characters second only to <em>The Wire</em>. Every season is darker than the next. My favorite episode,
                    is one of the funniest episodes I've ever seen. Who knows, maybe Tony survives the hit on the last scene. <blockquote>"All due respect,
                        you got no idea what it's like to be number one. Every decision you make, effects every facet of every other thing. It's too much to deal 
                        with almost. And in the end, you're completely alone with it all." - Tony Soprano
                    </blockquote></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Godfather</h4>
                    <p>As Don Corleone tells Michael "I never wanted this for you." Destiny is a matter of choices but for Michael it always seemed that his path
                        was to the family's illegal business.  If you ever want to see a movie about character development, look no further than Michael Corleone.
                        <blockquote>"Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever" - Michael Corleone</blockquote>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>The Wire</h4>
                    <p>You come at the King, you best not miss. <em>The Wire</em> is the greatest TV show ever and should be number one if it wasn't for my personal
                    affection to the Corleone family. This universe is huge with so many characters and storylines. This show is a beautiful chess match with a 
                lot of <blockquote>"All the pieces matter." - Lester</blockquote></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>The Godfather 2</h4>
                    <p>My favorite movie of all time. Vito and Michael's rise to the power shows us both men's tenacity and cleverness with Vito being the only
                        one to keep the family together. Most importantly, the heartbreaking relationship of Michael and his brother Fredo is powerful and deep.
                        <blockquote>"It's not easy to a son." - Michael</blockquote>
